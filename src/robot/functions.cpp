/**
 * @brief Translates controller input to drivetrain movements
 *
 * This function detects vertical movements on the joysticks of the controller, and
 * based on how much each joystick is moved up or down, supplies voltage to the drivetrain
 * motors of the corresponding side. The left side of the drive train is controlled by the
 * left joystick, and the right side of the drive train is controlled by the right joystick.
 * Down reverses the wheels, and up moves them forward. When the joysticks have unequal
 * magnitudes, the robot will turn in the direction of the one with the greater magnitude.
 * The vertical directional buttons on the controller can be used to move the drivetrain
 * at maximum speed in the forward (up arrow) or backwards (down arrow) direction.
